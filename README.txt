Set a custom URL for your author name link, on a global or author-specific basis. Also redirects all author pages.

== Description ==

This plugin will allow you to choose a custom URL for your author links, instead of the standard WordPress author page.
This can be useful if you want to link to your own Twitter, LinkedIn or other social media profile.

There are two areas where this plugin can be configured: 

Firstly, a global settings section is available under WordPress Settings. Second, under each users profile page.

A user can set their own custom URL on their profile page, and this will apply just to them. 
This can can be overriden by the global admin setting, if the 'Override Individual Authors' setting is checked.

Custom author URL's also redirect author pages when directly accessed. 
For example if your user is called Bob, and you try to access https://yourblog.com/author/bob, it will redirect.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I set it to open in a new tab? =

Not at the moment, this will have to be configured via the theme until I find a reliable way of doing this.

Yes, I have two other ( completely free ) plugins called WP Dev Flag & WP Custom Author URL, both on the Wordpress Repository here:
